## Basic SLA

Rulebricks offers a common SLA with varying minimum response and resolution times for two levels of issues: low, and high severity.

We define "high severity" issues as bugs/errors that prevent the development and correct execution of rule or flow assets on our platform, directly impeding your team from gaining value from our software.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="🚥">
  Please note the response and resolution times provided below are maximums, and
  you can often expect faster progress, particularly during business hours
  within **Pacific Standard Time**.
</Callout>

#### **Low Severity**

- 48 hour maximum response time
- 10 day resolution time

#### **High Severity**

- 24 hour maximum response time
- 3 day resolution time

If Rulebricks breaks the SLA in two consecutive months or over three months in any 12-month period, then Customer may, as its only remedy, terminate this Order Form upon notice and receive a prorated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the Subscription Period.

## High SLA

Our High SLA is available to customers of our Embedded (Enterprise) plans and offers response & resolution times at the extremes of what we are able to support, including 24/7 direct on-call lines, 4-8 hour response times, and significant service credits for violations.

Rule engines require a great degree of trust & vendor responsibility. Our High SLA is our word that- should anything go wrong– we'll be online.
