# Why Rulebricks Embedded?

Rulebricks Embedded is for engineering teams who need to deliver **enterprise-grade rule configuration** to their users _now_, without diverting their roadmap for six months to build a rule engine from scratch.

When your product needs advanced user-configurable logic—like dynamic pricing, eligibility criteria, or routing rules— many engineering teams face a difficult choice:

1.  **Build it yourself**: You spend a month building a decision table UI/backend. You soon discover that features like undo/redo stacks, copy/paste support, change tracking, caching, and performant execution against large datasets are massive engineering sinks.
2.  **Use a traditional BRMS**: You get a powerful engine, but you compromise your client experience. Your users are redirected to a third-party dashboard that doesn't look or feel like your product, despite your white-labeling.

Rulebricks Embedded eliminates this compromise. Paired with our SDK, it offers you a unique native-component that allows you to **buy an engine, but build the experience.**

## Built with React, Compatible with Everything

While we ship primarily as a React component, Rulebricks Embedded is designed to work within any modern frontend stack. The component is self-contained and can be mounted into:

- **Angular & Vue**: Using standard wrapper patterns or mounting helpers.
- **Next.js / Remix**: Full support for Server Components and SSR.
- **.NET / Blazor**: Embeddable within Razor pages or Blazor components via JS interop.
- **Internal Tools**: Easily mountable in Retool (custom component) or plain HTML/JS dashboards.
