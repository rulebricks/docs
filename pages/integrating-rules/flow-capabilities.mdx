# Flow Functions

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components'
import FlowNodeCard from '../../components/FlowNodeCard'
import {
  IconRouteAltRight,
  IconBraces,
  IconBrandCitymapper,
  IconCode,
  IconDatabase,
  IconApiApp,
  IconBracketsContain,
  IconSparkles,
  IconLock,
  IconCloud,
  IconFocusCentered,
  IconBell,
} from '@tabler/icons-react'

While your configurable rules are undoubtedly the most valuable pieces Flows expose, we offer several built-in functions to help your team collect data from external sources and run logic conditionally.

We call these "flow functions"– special operations you can use in your flows to perform various actions beyond rule execution. Below are all the available flow function node types– but do try our application or reach out to get information on our latest capabilities.

## Continue If

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="orange"
  icon={<IconRouteAltRight className="w-3 h-3 rotate-90" />}
  name="Continue If"
  description="Evaluate if an input property is true/truthy and only proceed with specific data if so."
/>

![Continue If](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/integrating-rules/continue-if.png)

Proceed based on one of four selectable conditions:

- If a specific property is **"truthy"** (not empty, non-zero, non-null)
- If a specific property is exactly **`true`**
- If a specific property is exactly **`false`**
- If a specific property is **"falsy"** (empty list, zero, null, or false)

If the condition is met, the flow continues along the exiting edges. Use two "Continue If" nodes to model if/else logic.

<Callout>
  All data you want to proceed with after a Continue If node must be wired in as
  inputs.
</Callout>

## Result Object

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="amber"
  icon={<IconBraces className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="Result Object"
  description="Nest data in a result object within a specific key to better organize the final output of your flow."
/>

![Result Object](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/integrating-rules/result.png)

The final output of your flow. It collects results from all preceding nodes and returns them as the flow's response.

- You can use multiple Result Object nodes with unique keys
- **Required**: Every flow must end with at least one Result Object node

## Lookup Table

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="green"
  icon={<IconBrandCitymapper className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="Lookup Table"
  description="Map an input 'key' to any output 'value' based on a table of key & value pairs."
/>

![Lookup Table](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/integrating-rules/lookup-table.png)

Look up a value in a table and return a corresponding value if an exact match is found. Works well with Continue If nodes by returning true/false based on lookup results.

## Run Code

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="sky"
  icon={<IconCode className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="Run Code"
  description="Execute custom JavaScript to perform operations like computing data, making API calls, or integrating with external services."
/>

![Run Code](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/integrating-rules/code.png)

Run custom JavaScript code using data from your flow. Useful for:

- Making calls to external services
- Performing complex calculations
- Custom string formatting or data transformation

Available libraries: `fetch`, `moment`, `lodash`, and more.

Access connected values via the `inputs` dictionary and return values via the `outputs` dictionary.

```javascript
// Example: Calculate discount
const total = inputs.subtotal
const discount = total > 100 ? total * 0.1 : 0
outputs['discount'] = discount
outputs['final_total'] = total - discount
```

## SOAP Request

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="cyan"
  icon={<IconCloud className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="SOAP Request"
  description="Connect to SOAP/XML web services using WSDL to call operations on enterprise systems."
/>

Connect to SOAP/XML web services to integrate with legacy enterprise systems. Upload a WSDL file to auto-discover available operations.

Features:

- WSDL-based service discovery
- Support for complex XML request/response structures
- Built-in authentication options

## Database Query

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="blue"
  icon={<IconDatabase className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="Database Query"
  description="Query a PostgreSQL database to fetch data from an external resource and use it in this flow."
/>

![Database Query](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/integrating-rules/db.png)

Query a PostgreSQL, MSSQL, or MySQL database, and return results. Variables from your flow can be used in the query.

Features:

- Use `rows` with a For Each node or send directly to Result Object
- Built-in 1-minute caching for performance

## API Request

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="indigo"
  icon={<IconApiApp className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="API Request"
  description="Make an HTTP request to any API to fetch & send data from/to external resources."
/>

![API Request](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/integrating-rules/api.png)

Make HTTP requests to external APIs. Variables from your flow can be used in the URL, headers, and body.

Features:

- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- Custom headers and authentication
- Built-in 1-minute caching, customizable cache key

## For Each

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="red"
  icon={<IconBracketsContain className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="For Each"
  description="Perform following operations on each available item in a non-empty list of values/objects, and return a list of results."
/>

![For Each](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/integrating-rules/for-each.png)

Iterate over a list of items and apply a rule to each one. Perfect for:

- Transforming collections of objects
- Processing lists of orders, users, or products
- Batch operations

<Callout type="warning">
  For Each nodes must culminate in a Result Object node. Values inside the loop
  cannot connect to parts of the flow outside that loop (indicated by different
  edge colors).
</Callout>

## AI Inference

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="fuchsia"
  icon={<IconSparkles className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="AI Inference"
  description="Intelligently parse out structured properties from text using AI models to evaluate rules against."
/>

![AI Inference](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/integrating-rules/ai-inference.png)

Extract structured data from text using OpenAI. Useful for:

- Parsing emails and reports
- Extracting specific information from documents
- NLP preprocessing before rule execution

To use:

1. Connect a text input
2. Define target labels to extract
3. Click "Run Inference"

## Vault

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="slate"
  icon={<IconLock className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="Vault"
  description="Connect to secure key vaults to retrieve secrets at runtime without exposing credentials."
/>

![Vault](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/integrating-rules/vault.png)

Security features:

- Secrets never appear in clear text in the flow
- Cannot be logged or returned in output
- Only accessible within Run Code nodes

## Context Operation

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="violet"
  icon={<IconFocusCentered className="w-3 h-3" />}
  name="Context Operation"
  description="Read, update, or delete context data. Use for stateful context data operations within flows."
/>

Interact with [Rulebricks Contexts](/contexts) directly from your flow. Perfect for:

- Reading entity data to use in rule evaluation
- Updating context properties based on flow outcomes
- Deleting or archiving context records

<Callout type="info">
  Context Operations require a configured Context in your workspace. See the
  [Contexts documentation](/contexts) for setup instructions.
</Callout>

## Send Notification

<FlowNodeCard
  colorScheme="neutral"
  icon={<IconBell className="w-3 h-3" />}
