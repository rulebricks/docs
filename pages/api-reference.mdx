### Rulebricks SDK

Rulebricks SDK's make it possible to use rules in your applications in as few as 3 lines of code. We currently provide SDKs for [Python](#python), [Node.js/Typescript](#nodejstypescript), [Java](#java), and [Go](#go), with more coming soon.

#### <ins>Python</ins>

[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/rulebricks.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rulebricks)

The [Rulebricks Python SDK](https://github.com/rulebricks/python-sdk) provides convenient access to the Rulebricks API from Python. SDK usage largely mirrors the API itself, with methods for solving rules, bulk solving rules, and more.

##### Installation

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```bash
pip install rulebricks
# or
poetry add rulebricks
```

##### Configuration

Before using the SDK, configure your API key. You can find your API key in your Rulebricks Dashboard.

```python
import rulebricks as rb

# Replace 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX' with your actual API key
rb.configure(
    api_key="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    # base_url="https://rulebricks.com" # Optional: Use this to override the default base URL for private cloud deployments
    # timeout=10 # Optional: Use this to override the default timeout in seconds
)
```

##### Basic Usage

Using the SDK to interact with the Rulebricks API in a synchronous manner is simple.

Here's an example of how to use our Python SDK to solve a rule:

```python
import rulebricks as rb

# Set the API key
rb.configure(
    api_key="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
)

result = rb.rules.solve(
    slug="tJOCd8XXXX",
    request={
        "customer_id": "anc39as3",
        "purchase_history": ["t-shirt", "mug"],
        "account_age_days": 4,
        "last_purchase_days_ago": 3,
        "email_subscription": False
    }
)

print(result)
```

##### Asynchronous Usage

For asynchronous API calls, access methods via the async_api attribute.

This allows you to leverage Python's asyncio library for non-blocking operations:

```python
import rulebricks as rb
import asyncio

# Set the API key
rb.configure(
    api_key="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
)

async def main():
    async_result = await rb.async_api.rules.solve(
        slug="tJOCd8XXXX",
        request={
            "customer_id": "anc39as3",
            "purchase_history": ["t-shirt", "mug"],
            "account_age_days": 4,
            "last_purchase_days_ago": 3,
            "email_subscription": False
        }
    )
    print(async_result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Using a combination of `solve`, `bulk_solve`, `parallel_solve` and `flows` in synchronous or asynchronous modes gives you high flexibility to interact with the Rulebricks API in a way that best suits your application's needs.

##### Forge SDK

The Forge SDK is a powerful tool within the Rulebricks package that allows you to programmatically create and manage rules. It provides a flexible and intuitive way to define rule sets, conditions, and responses.

### Purpose

The Forge SDK enables you to:
- Define complex rule structures
- Create and manage conditions within rules
- Specify request and response schemas
- Generate rule representations in various formats (JSON, tabular, file)

### Creating a Rule

Here's an example of how to create a simple rule using the Forge SDK:

```python
from rulebricks import RuleBuilder, RuleType
from rulebricks.forge import BooleanOperator, NumberOperator, StringOperator, boolean_op, number_op, string_op

# Initialize a new RuleBuilder
builder = RuleBuilder()

# Set name and description
builder.set_name("Customer Discount Eligibility")
builder.set_description("Determines if a customer is eligible for a discount based on their purchase history and account status.")

# Define schema
builder.add_request_field("purchase_count", "Purchase Count", RuleType.NUMBER, "Number of purchases made", 0)
builder.add_request_field("is_subscribed", "Is Subscribed", RuleType.BOOLEAN, "Whether the customer is subscribed to the newsletter", False)
builder.add_request_field("customer_type", "Customer Type", RuleType.STRING, "Type of customer (regular, premium, vip)", "regular")

builder.add_response_field("discount_eligible", "Discount Eligible", RuleType.BOOLEAN, "Whether the customer is eligible for a discount", False)
builder.add_response_field("discount_percentage", "Discount Percentage", RuleType.NUMBER, "Percentage of discount to apply", 0)

# Create conditions
condition1 = builder.add_condition()
builder.update_condition(condition1, "purchase_count", *number_op(NumberOperator.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO)(10))
builder.update_condition(condition1, "is_subscribed", *boolean_op(BooleanOperator.IS_TRUE)())
builder.update_condition(condition1, "customer_type", *string_op(StringOperator.EQUALS)("regular"))
builder.set_condition_response(condition1, "discount_eligible", True)
builder.set_condition_response(condition1, "discount_percentage", 5)

condition2 = builder.add_condition()
builder.update_condition(condition2, "customer_type", *string_op(StringOperator.EQUALS)("premium"))
builder.set_condition_response(condition2, "discount_eligible", True)
builder.set_condition_response(condition2, "discount_percentage", 10)
```

### Available Operators

The Forge SDK provides a range of operators for different data types. You can find the full list of available operators in the following files:

- `src/rulebricks/forge/operators.py`

This file contains the definitions for `BooleanOperator`, `NumberOperator`, `StringOperator`, `DateOperator`, and `ListOperator`.

### Outputting Rules

The Forge SDK offers several ways to output your rules:

1. **JSON Output**

   To get a JSON representation of your rule:

   ```python
   json_output = builder.to_json()
   print(json_output)
   ```

2. **Pretty Print (Tabular Format)**

   To get a human-readable tabular representation of your rule:

   ```python
   table_output = builder.to_table()
   print(table_output)
   ```

   This might produce output similar to:

   ```
   +---------------+---------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------+
   | purchase_count | is_subscribed |  customer_type  | discount_eligible | discount_percentage  |
   +===============+===============+=================+===================+======================+
   | greater than   | is true       | equals          | True              | 5                    |
   | or equal to    | ()            | (regular)       |                   |                      |
   | (10)           |               |                 |                   |                      |
   +---------------+---------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------+
   | -              | -             | equals          | True              | 10                   |
   |                |               | (premium)       |                   |                      |
   +---------------+---------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------+
   ```

3. **Export to File**

   To export your rule to a file for import through the Rulebricks UI:

   ```python
   filename = builder.export()
   print(f"Rule exported to: {filename}")
   ```

   This will create a file with the `.rbx` extension in your current directory. The filename will be based on the rule name you set, with "-Generated.rbx" appended.

### Complete Example

Here's a complete example that demonstrates creating a rule and using all output methods:

```python
from rulebricks import RuleBuilder, RuleType
from rulebricks.forge import BooleanOperator, NumberOperator, StringOperator, boolean_op, number_op, string_op

def create_customer_discount_rule():
    builder = RuleBuilder()

    builder.set_name("Customer Discount Eligibility")
    builder.set_description("Determines if a customer is eligible for a discount based on their purchase history and account status.")

    builder.add_request_field("purchase_count", "Purchase Count", RuleType.NUMBER, "Number of purchases made", 0)
    builder.add_request_field("is_subscribed", "Is Subscribed", RuleType.BOOLEAN, "Whether the customer is subscribed to the newsletter", False)
    builder.add_request_field("customer_type", "Customer Type", RuleType.STRING, "Type of customer (regular, premium, vip)", "regular")

    builder.add_response_field("discount_eligible", "Discount Eligible", RuleType.BOOLEAN, "Whether the customer is eligible for a discount", False)
    builder.add_response_field("discount_percentage", "Discount Percentage", RuleType.NUMBER, "Percentage of discount to apply", 0)

    condition1 = builder.add_condition()
    builder.update_condition(condition1, "purchase_count", *number_op(NumberOperator.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO)(10))
    builder.update_condition(condition1, "is_subscribed", *boolean_op(BooleanOperator.IS_TRUE)())
    builder.update_condition(condition1, "customer_type", *string_op(StringOperator.EQUALS)("regular"))
    builder.set_condition_response(condition1, "discount_eligible", True)
    builder.set_condition_response(condition1, "discount_percentage", 5)

    condition2 = builder.add_condition()
    builder.update_condition(condition2, "customer_type", *string_op(StringOperator.EQUALS)("premium"))
    builder.set_condition_response(condition2, "discount_eligible", True)
    builder.set_condition_response(condition2, "discount_percentage", 10)

    return builder

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rule = create_customer_discount_rule()

    # JSON output
    print("JSON Output:")
    print(rule.to_json())
    print("\n")

    # Table output
    print("Table Output:")
    print(rule.to_table())
    print("\n")

    # Export to file
    filename = rule.export()
    print(f"Rule exported to: {filename}")
```

#### <ins>Node.js/Typescript</ins>

[![npm shield](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@rulebricks/api)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rulebricks/api)

The [Rulebricks Node.js library](https://github.com/rulebricks/node-sdk) provides convenient access to the Rulebricks API from JavaScript/TypeScript. SDK usage largely mirrors the API itself, with methods for solving rules, bulk solving rules, and more.

##### Installation

```
npm install --save @rulebricks/api
# or
yarn add @rulebricks/api
```

##### Usage

```typescript
import { RulebricksClient } from '@rulebricks/api';

const rulebricks = new RulebricksClient({
  apiKey: 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX',
  environment: 'https://rulebricks.com',
});

rulebricks.rules.solve('tJOCd8XXXX', {
  customer_id: 'anc39as3',
  purchase_history: ['t-shirt', 'mug'],,
  account_age_days: 4,
  last_purchase_days_ago: 3,
  email_subscription: false,
}, {
  // Request options (Optional, leave empty for default values)
  // timeoutInSeconds: 10, (Optional: Use this to override the default timeout in seconds)
  // maxRetries: 3, (Optional: Use this to override the default number of retries)
}).then((result) => {
  console.log(result);
}).catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

##### Handling errors

When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of `RulebricksApiError` will be thrown:

```ts
try {
  // ...
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof RulebricksApiError) {
    console.log(err.statusCode) // 400
    console.log(err.message) // "BadRequestError"
    console.log(err.body) // list of errors
  }
}
```

Error codes are as followed:

| Status Code | Error Type            |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`     |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`      |
| 500         | `InternalServerError` |

#### <ins>Java</ins>

The [Rulebricks Java SDK](https://github.com/rulebricks/java-sdk) provides convenient access to the Rulebricks API from Java applications. SDK usage allows for solving rules, bulk solving rules, and more.

##### Installation

For Maven, add this dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.rulebricks</groupId>
  <artifactId>rulebricks-sdk-java</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.rulebricks:rulebricks-sdk-java:1.0.0'
```

##### Configuration

Instantiate a `RulebricksApiClient` with your API key:

```java
RulebricksApiClient client = RulebricksApiClient.builder()
    .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
    .build();
```

##### Basic Usage

Solve a rule:

```java
Map<String, Object> requestData = new HashMap<>();
requestData.put("dataKey", "dataValue");

Map<String, Object> result = client.rules().solve("<rule-slug>", requestData);
```

Bulk solve rules:

```java
List<Map<String, Object>> requestDataList = new ArrayList<>();
requestDataList.add(requestData);

List<Map<String, Object>> results = client.rules().bulkSolve("<rule-slug>", requestDataList);
```

Parallel solving rules requires a particular format using `$rule` alongside respective data payloads:

```java
Map<String, Map<String, Object>> requestDataMap = new HashMap<>();
requestDataMap.put("eligibility", {
    "$rule": "1ef03ms",
    "customer_id": "anc39as3",
    "purchase_history": ["t-shirt", "mug"],
    "account_age_days": 4,
    "last_purchase_days_ago": 3,
    "email_subscription": false
});
requestDataMap.put("offers", {
    "$rule": "OvmsYwn",
    "customer_id": "anc39as3",
    "last_purchase_days_ago": 3,
    "selected_plan": "premium"
});

Map<String, Object> results = client.rules().parallelSolve(requestDataMap);
```

##### Error Handling

The SDK throws exceptions to indicate API errors:

```java
try {
    Map<String, Object> result = client.rules().solve("<rule-slug>", requestData);
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle the error
}
```

#### <ins>Go</ins>

The [Rulebricks Go SDK](https://github.com/rulebricks/go-sdk) provides convenient access to the Rulebricks API from Go applications. SDK usage largely mirrors the API itself, with methods for solving rules, bulk solving rules, and more.

##### Installation

To use the Rulebricks Go SDK in your project, you can install it using `go get`:

```sh
go get github.com/rulebricks/go-sdk
```

##### Configuration

Before you can start using the SDK, you need to configure it with your Rulebricks API key. You can do this by creating a client with the `NewClient` function and passing in your API key as a request option:

```go
import (
    "github.com/rulebricks/go-sdk/client"
    "github.com/rulebricks/go-sdk/option"
    "net/http"
)

opts := option.WithAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
client := client.NewClient(opts)
```

##### Basic Usage

To solve a rule with the SDK, you can use the `Solve` function of the client. Here's an example of how to solve a rule identified by its unique slug:

```go
response, err := client.Rules.Solve(context.Background(), "<rule-slug>", map[string]interface{}{
    "data": "your-data-here",
})
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
// Use the response
```

For bulk operations, you can use the `BulkSolve` function to execute a rule against multiple data payloads:

```go
responses, err := client.Rules.BulkSolve(context.Background(), "<rule-slug>", []map[string]interface{}{
    {"data": "first-payload"},
    {"data": "second-payload"},
    // Add more payloads as needed
})
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
// Use the responses
```

To execute multiple rules in parallel, use the `ParallelSolve` function, along with the special parallel solve format:

```go
responses, err := client.Rules.ParallelSolve(context.Background(), map[string]interface{}{
    "eligibility":  {"$rule": "tJOCd8XX", "customer_id": "anc39as3", "purchase_history": []string{"t-shirt", "mug"}, "account_age_days": 4, "last_purchase_days_ago": 3, "email_subscription": false},
    "offers": {"$rule": "Ovms3XX", "customer_id": "anc39as3", "last_purchase_days_ago": 3, "selected_plan": "premium"},
    // Note the non top-level keyword $rule is used to identify the rule to be executed
    // alongside the data payload that should be passed to that particular rule
})
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
// Use the responses
```

##### Asynchronous Usage

The SDK supports asynchronous operations using Go routines. You can use the `Solve`, `BulkSolve`, and `ParallelSolve` functions within a goroutine for concurrent rule solving:

```go
go func() {
    response, err := client.Rules.Solve(context.Background(), "<rule-slug>", map[string]interface{}{
        "data": "your-data-here",
    })
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }
    // Use the response
}()
```

##### Error Handling

The SDK returns errors that can be handled in a typical Go error handling pattern:

```go
response, err := client.Rules.Solve(...)
if err != nil {
    // Handle the error
}
```

##### Feedback and Contributions

We welcome feedback and contributions to the SDK. Please report any issues or suggestions through the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rulebricks/go-sdk/issues).

For contributions, please submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes and any relevant tests.
