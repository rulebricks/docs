# Build your first rule

Let's get started building a rule. First, go to the [dashboard](https://rulebricks.com/dashboard). If this is your first time creating a rule, it will look something like this:

![Dashboard Entry](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/app-entry.png)

import { Steps, Tabs, Callout } from 'nextra/components'
import {
  IconBrackets,
  IconCalendar,
  Icon123,
  IconAlphabetLatin,
  IconCheckbox,
  IconMathFunction,
} from '@tabler/icons-react'

## Creating Your First Rule

<Steps>

### Create a new rule

Click the **Create Rule** button in the top right. You'll be presented with a dialog to configure your new rule.

![Create Rule Modal](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/create-new-rule-modal.png)

Choose **From Scratch** to build a rule from the ground up.

![From Scratch](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/from-scratch.png)

### Open the editor

Your rule will be created, and you'll be dropped into the **rule editor**. This is where you'll define your decision logic.

![Table Editor Entry](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/table-editor-entry.png)

</Steps>

## Understanding the Rule Table

The **rule table** is the main area where you define your decision logic. It's split into two sections:

- **Request (Conditions)**: The left side contains the conditions that determine which row matches
- **Response (Results)**: The right side contains the values returned when a row matches

At the top of each column is the **column header** showing the column name and data type icon.

### Data Types

Rulebricks supports several types of data commonly used in decision-making:

<Tabs items={['List', 'Number', 'Date', 'Text', 'Boolean', 'Function']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

<IconBrackets size={64} className="bg-sky-100 text-sky-800 rounded-md border border-sky-300 p-2"/>

A list is a collection of items. Each item in the list can be of a different type.

```jsx
[1, 2, 3]
["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

Example operations: Checking if a list contains a value, checking if a list is empty, checking length.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

<Icon123 size={64} className="bg-red-100 text-red-800 rounded-md border border-red-300 p-2"/>

A number is a numerical value—integer or floating-point.

```jsx
3.14
42
-100
```

Example operations: Greater than, less than, equal to, within range.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

<IconCalendar size={64} className="bg-orange-200 text-orange-500 rounded-md border border-orange-500 p-2"/>

A date is a calendar date and time in ISO 8601 format.

```jsx
"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
```

Example operations: Before, after, within last N days.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

<IconAlphabetLatin size={64} className="bg-green-200 text-green-500 rounded-md border border-green-500 p-2"/>

Text is a string of characters.

```jsx
"Hello, world!"
"approved"
```

Example operations: Equals, contains, starts with, is valid email.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

<IconCheckbox size={64} className="bg-purple-200 text-purple-500 rounded-md border border-purple-500 p-2"/>

A boolean is a logical value: true or false.

```jsx
true
false
```

Example operations: Is true, is false.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

<IconMathFunction size={64} className="bg-neutral-200 text-neutral-500 rounded-md border border-neutral-500 p-2"/>

A function is a mathematical expression that computes a value.

<Callout>
Functions can only be used in the response section to compute values based on request data.
</Callout>

```jsx
price * 1.08  // Add 8% tax
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting Up Your Schema

The schema defines what data your rule accepts (request) and returns (response).

<Steps>

### Open the Schema Editor

Click on the **Schema** button to open the schema editor. This is where you define your input and output fields.

![Schema Editor](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/schema-editor.png)

You can also use **JSON mode** to paste a sample request object directly:

![Schema Editor JSON Mode](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/schema-editor-json-mode.png)

### Configure the Request Schema

Let's create a simple pricing rule. Set up your request schema with:

```json
{
  "price": 40,
  "date_purchased": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "gift": false
}
```

Click **Set Schema** to apply the changes.

![Set Schema](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/set-schema.png)

### View Column Details

You can click on any column header to see and edit its details, including type and display name.

![Column Details](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/column-details.png)

### Save the Schema

Click **Save** to apply your schema changes.

![Save Schema](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/save-schema.png)

### Set Up the Response Schema

Configure what your rule returns. For our example:

```json
{
  "result": true
}
```

![Set Response Schema](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/set-save-response-schema.png)

</Steps>

## Adding Conditions and Results

Now let's add the actual decision logic to your rule.

<Steps>

### Add a condition

Click on a condition cell in the **price** column and add a condition. Let's check if the price is greater than 10.

![Create Price Condition](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/create-price-condition.png)

### Set the result

Click on the result cell in the **result** column and set the value to **true**.

![Create Result](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/create-result.png)

</Steps>

## Testing Your Rule

<Steps>

### Open the Test tab

Click on the **Test** tab in the sidebar to test your rule locally.

![Test Rule](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/test-rule.png)

### Test with matching data

Enter a test request:

```json
{
  "price": 20
}
```

Click **Test**. You should see the row highlight in green (conditions matched) and blue (result returned), with a 200 OK response.

### Test with non-matching data

Try a price that doesn't match:

```json
{
  "price": 5
}
```

![Nothing Hit](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/nothing-hit.png)

Since the price is not greater than 10, no row matches, and you'll get a 400 error.

</Steps>

## Adding a Catch-All Row

To handle cases where no specific condition matches, add a catch-all row.

<Steps>

### Add a new row

Click **Add Row** in the toolbar to add a blank row.

![Add Catch All](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/add-catch-all.png)

### Leave conditions as "Any"

The new row will have **Any** for all conditions, meaning it matches any input that doesn't match earlier rows.

### Set the catch-all result

Set the result to **false** for the catch-all row.

### Test again

Test with the price of 5 again:

![Catch All Hit](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/catch-all-hit.png)

Now the catch-all row matches, returning `result: false` with a 200 OK response.

</Steps>

## Final Rule State

Your completed rule should look like this:

![Final Rule State](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/start-building/final-rule-state.png)

**Row 1**: If price > 10 → result: true
**Row 2**: Catch-all → result: false

## How Row Matching Works

Rulebricks evaluates rows **top to bottom**:

1. For each row, all conditions in the request section are checked
2. If **all** conditions in a row pass, that row "matches"
3. The **first matching row** determines the response
4. If **no rows match**, an error is returned (unless you have a catch-all)

<Callout>
Cells highlighted in **green** indicate conditions that passed. Cells highlighted in **red** indicate conditions that failed. Cells highlighted in **blue** show the result that was returned.
</Callout>

That's it! You've built and tested your first rule. Continue to the next section to learn how to [publish your rule](/managing-rules/publishing-rules) and call it from your application.
