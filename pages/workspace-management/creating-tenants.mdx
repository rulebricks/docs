# Creating Tenants

Each instance of Rulebricks comes with the ability to create **unlimited** "tenants" within your workspace, called "User Groups". User Groups leverage database-level policies to selectively grant users access to specific assets in your account, ensuring that they only have access to the decisions they care about.

User Groups are editable via the dashboard by the workspace owner/administrator, or via the API. Leveraging our API to invite users, create new groups, and add users to these groups can be particularly powerful for provisioning Rulebricks internally.

In essence, this could mean the number of unique Rulebricks workspaces you are limited to creating is simply the number of users your plan supports. On our unlimited plan, you could have as many unique Rulebricks workspaces as your business requires within a single plan with no proration at all.
