# User Groups

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

User Groups partition your workspace into isolated sections. Users only see rules and flows in their assigned groups—useful for multi-team organizations, client isolation, or separating environments.

<Steps>

### Create a group

Go to **Team → User Groups** and click **Create User Group**. Give it a name and description.

### Assign users

Add users to the group. Users can belong to multiple groups. Their [role permissions](/workspace-management/assigning-roles) apply within their group scope.

</Steps>

Administrators & Developers, by default, see all groups and data within. Everyone else sees only their assigned groups, and data explicitly assigned to that group.

  User Groups are unlimited on all plans—create as many as you need at no
  additional cost.
