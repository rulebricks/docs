# Assigning Roles

You can assign roles to users in your workspace by navigating to the "Team" tab in your Rulebricks dashboard and selecting the role you'd like to assign to a user.

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### Open the role dialog

To assign a role to a user, find the user in the "Team" tab of your Rulebricks dashboard and click on the pencil icon next to their role.

### Select a role

A dialog will appear where you can select the role you'd like to assign to the user. You can assign one of two built-in system roles: Developer, and Editor– the Administrator role is reserved exclusively for the workspace owner, and cannot be assigned to other users. If you've created any custom role, you can select among them here as well.

## System Role Overviews

### Developer

Developers have full access to your workspace, with the exception of editing the team as an administrator, or viewing/modifying billing settings. Developers can otherwise create, edit, and delete rules, view your API key, as well as view logs and other workspace settings.

Users who are assigned this role should be fully trusted, internal team members who need full access to your workspace.

### Editor

Editors have highly limited access to your workspace, with the ability to view & edit pre-existing rules, view dynamic values, and a list of other team members. Editors do not have access to your API key, and cannot view or edit billing, team, and rule settings. Editors also do not have access to workspace logs, and Rulebricks Flows.

Users who are assigned this role should be external collaborators or clients who still need to view and propose changes rules.

## Custom Roles

In addition to the default roles, you can create custom roles with specific permissions to nearly any aspect of your workspace.

Custom roles can be assigned to users who require more granular access control. This can be incredibly useful for tailoring Rulebricks to specific end-users when embedded in your applications or served to external clients.
