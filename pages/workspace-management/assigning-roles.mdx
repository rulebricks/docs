## System Roles

**Developer** — Full access to rules, flows, API keys, logs, Dynamic Values, and settings. Cannot edit team membership or billing.

**Editor** — Can view and edit existing rules. Cannot create/delete rules, access API keys, logs, flows, or settings.

## Custom Roles

For granular control, create custom roles with exactly the permissions you need.
