# Inviting Collaborators

You can invite collaborators to your workspace by navigating to the "Team" tab in your Rulebricks dashboard and inviting them by email.

It's important to note that collaborators will have full access to your workspace, with the sole exception of editing the team as an administrator (you), including the ability to create, edit, and delete rules, view your API key, as well as view logs and other workspace settings.

Collaborators will not be able to view or edit your billing information, or change your subscription plan.

Once you've invited a collaborator, they will receive an email inviting them to join your workspace. They will need to accept the invitation to gain access. You will then see them listed in the "Team" tab of your workspace.
