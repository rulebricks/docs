# Managing Subscriptions

You can manage your Rulebricks subscription from the "Billing" account menu tab in your Rulebricks dashboard.

Rulebricks uses Stripe to manage subscriptions, so you can update your payment information, view your current subscription plan, and change your subscription plan securely from this tab.

### Launch the customer portal

Clicking on the "Billing" tab will launch the Rulebricks customer portal, where you can manage your subscription and billing information.

If you do not have an active subscription, you will be instead navigated to our pricing page, where you can select a plan and start your subscription.
