# Publishing Rules

Publishing makes your rule available via the API, in Forms, and in Rule Flows. Every publish creates a new version—you can target specific versions, compare changes, and roll back if needed.

## Create a new version

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### Open the publish menu

Click the **Publish** button in the top right corner of the rule editor.

### Publish your rule

You'll see a history of prior versions. Click **Publish** to create a new version.

<Callout type="info">
  You can click on the colored tags in this menu ("Conditions", "Request
  Schema", etc.) to see a summary of what changed between versions.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Versioning

Each publish creates a numbered version (v1, v2, etc.). Target specific versions by appending the number to the rule slug:

- `hlDPsJMVGQ` → latest version
- `hlDPsJMVGQ/2` → version 2 specifically

This lets you build highly stable and customizable deployment workflows around your rules while developing future versions.

<Callout>
  The clock icon next to each version lets you **roll back**. This is
  destructive—versions between your current state and the rollback target are
  permanently lost as API targets.
</Callout>

## Comparing Versions

Before publishing, compare your working changes against any previous version to see exactly what's different.

Click **Compare Versions** in the rule editor header:

![Compare Versions Button](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/comparing-rules/find-compare-button.png)

The comparison view shows your working changes side-by-side with the selected version. Added rows, removed rows, and modified conditions are highlighted:

![Rule Compare View](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/comparing-rules/rule-compare-view.png)

Use this to review changes before publishing, or to understand what changed between versions when investigating unexpected behavior.

<Callout type="info">
  New versions take effect roughly 1 minute after publishing while caches
  update.
