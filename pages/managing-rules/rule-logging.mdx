# Decision Logs

Every rule execution is logged with the full request, response, and which conditions matched. Use logs to debug issues, audit decisions, and understand how your rules behave in production.

import { Tabs, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  Logs are retained for up to 90 days on most plans and appear in the dashboard
  within seconds of execution.
</Callout>

## Viewing Logs

Navigate to the **Logs** tab in the dashboard.

![Logs Tab](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/logs/view-logs-tab.png)

Each entry shows:

- Request and response payloads
- Which conditions matched or failed
- HTTP status, IP address, timestamp, and duration

Filter by rule, status code, or date range to narrow down what you're looking for.

## Searching with DDQL

Decision Data Query Language lets you search by the actual data in your requests and responses.

For example, if I wanted to pull rule executions for a particular `application_id`, I might do the following:

![Query Logs with DDQL](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/logs/query-logs-ddql.png)

### Examples

```
credit_score >= 700 AND approval_decision = "denied"
customer_id = "CUST-12345"
amount > 10000 AND risk_score < 0.2
tier:gold OR tier:platinum
```

### Operators

| Operator          | Description                  | Example            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `=`               | Exact match                  | `status=approved`  |
| `!=`              | Not equals                   | `status!=rejected` |
| `:`               | Contains (strings) or equals | `name:Smith`       |
| `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | Comparisons                  | `score>=700`       |

Combine with `AND` and `OR`. Use parentheses for precedence:

```
(tier = "gold" AND amount > 100) OR tier = "platinum"
```

<Tabs items={['Strings', 'Numbers', 'Booleans', 'Bare Terms']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

Quotes optional unless value contains spaces:

```
status = approved
city = "New York"
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

Integers and decimals:

```
score >= 85.5
quantity = 0
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```
verified = true
flagged = false
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

Type a word to search anywhere in request or response:

```
timeout
error
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Field names are case-sensitive and must match your schema. Queries search both request and response payloads automatically.
