import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

### Name your export

### Automatically includes Values

Exports intelligently bundle all assets related to the item you're exporting. Exporting Flows also exports the rules within. Exporting rules also exports any values those rules reference.
This ensures you won't have to think about dependencies while moving around assets- all relevant data is self-contained within a single file.
