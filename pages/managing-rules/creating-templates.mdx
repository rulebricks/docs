# Team Templates

Team templates in Rulebricks are powerful ways to share common schemas and decision models with your end-users to help them bootstrap new projects. Templates are created from existing rules and are instantly available to anyone on your team via the create menu.

<Steps>

### Create a new rule

First, create a new rule in the Rulebricks editor, and set it up as you'd like your template to appear. Note that any settings you apply to your rule, including workflow settings like defining an approver and adding tests, will be carried directly over to the template.

### Publish the template

In the top menu bar inside the decision table editor, you'll see a "Create Template" button. Click this button to create a new template from your rule.

### Using the template

All published templates are available to your team in the "Create Rule" menu, under the templates tab. Administrator and Developer role users are able to delete templates to ensure an organized and up-to-date list of templates for your team.

Be sure to give your template a strongly identifying name and description to help your team understand its purpose. Templates are a great way to standardize your decision-making logic across your team and ensure consistency across rules.

  Note that templates are accessible to all users on your team, irrespective of
  their User Group. If this behavior is undesirable, another way to accomplish a
  similar goal is simply to create an example rule within a group, and have
  future end-users simply duplicate the rule to create their own version.
