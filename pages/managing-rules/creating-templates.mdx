# Team Templates

Templates let you capture a well-designed rule and make it available for your whole team to reuse, or for customers to use as a starting point.

When someone creates a new rule from a template, they get the schema, sample conditions, settings, and test cases, ready for them to customize.

While exported RBM files do save and contain the histories of exported decision assets, users importing them as Team Templates will not receive these histories.

## Creating a Template

<Steps>

### Build the rule you want to share

Create a rule with the schema, conditions, and settings you want others to start from. Include test cases if you want them copied to new rules.

### Save as template

Navigate to **Team → Templates** and click **Create Template**, or use the **Create Template** button in the rule editor.

You can also upload `.rbm` files directly to your templates.

## Using a Template

When creating a new rule, click the **Templates** tab in the create dialog. Team Templates should appear by default. If you're not seeing them, it's possible the template has been assigned to a specific User Group, and you may not be part of it.

## Managing Templates

- **Administrators** and **Developers** can create and delete templates
- All team members can view and use templates
- Templates can't be edited—create a new version with a clear name like `"Credit Check - v2"`

<Callout>
  Templates can have tenancy– if a template is assigned to a particular user
  group, only users belonging to that group will see it. Developers (usually
  unassigned to any user group) will only see templates that do not have any
  user group.
</Callout>

## Or, Duplicate

If templates feel heavyweight for your needs, users can always find an existing rule and click **Duplicate**. This works well for quick iterations or one-off copies.
