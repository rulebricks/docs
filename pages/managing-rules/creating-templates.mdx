# Team Templates

Templates let you capture a well-designed rule and make it available for your whole team to reuse. When someone creates a new rule from a template, they get the schema, sample conditions, settings, and test cases—ready to customize.

## Creating a Template

<Steps>

### Build the rule you want to share

Create a rule with the schema, conditions, and settings you want others to start from. Include test cases if you want them copied to new rules.

### Save as template

Navigate to **Team → Templates** and click **Create Template**, or use the **Create Template** button in the rule editor.

You can also upload `.rbm` files directly to your templates.

</Steps>

## Using a Template

When creating a new rule, click the **Templates** tab in the create dialog.

Select a template and you'll get a new rule with:
- Schema (request and response fields)
- Sample conditions and results
- Settings and configurations
- Test cases (if any were included)

Customize from there.

## Managing Templates

- **Administrators** and **Developers** can create and delete templates
- All team members can view and use templates
- Templates can't be edited—create a new version with a clear name like `"Credit Check - v2"`

<Callout>
Templates are accessible to all users on your team regardless of User Group. For group-specific starting points, create example rules within each group that users can duplicate.
</Callout>

## When to Use Duplicate Instead

If templates feel heavyweight for your needs, users can always open an existing rule and click **Duplicate**. This works well for quick iterations or one-off copies within a User Group.
