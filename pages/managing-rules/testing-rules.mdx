metaDescription: Test your rules before publishing with Try mode for quick checks and Suite mode for regression testing.

# Testing Rules

Test your rules before they hit production. Rulebricks gives you two modes: **Try** for quick single-request testing, and **Suite** for regression testing across multiple scenarios.

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Try Mode

Open the **Test** tab in the rule editor and select **Try**.

Paste a request object and click **Test**. The decision table lights up:
- **Green cells** — Conditions that matched
- **Red cells** — Conditions that didn't match
- **Blue/Yellow cells** — The results returned

This visual feedback shows exactly which row matched and why.

<Callout>
If you get an error, your rule doesn't handle that input. Check for missing conditions or add a catch-all row.
</Callout>

## Suite Mode

Switch to **Suite** mode to run multiple test cases at once.

![Test Suite](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/testing-rules/test-suite.png)

Build your suite by saving tests from Try mode. When a test produces the expected result, save it. Mark tests as **Critical** if they should block publishing when they fail.

<Callout type="info">
For large test suites, use the API to bulk upload test cases programmatically.
</Callout>

## Continuous Testing

Enable **Continuous Testing** in rule settings to run your test suite automatically before every publish.

When enabled, you'll see a test score next to every published version—the percentage of tests that passed. Critical tests prevent publishing if they fail; non-critical tests report results but don't block.
