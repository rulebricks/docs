Rulebricks helps you model important decisions in your business visually as "rules", and then integrate them into an automated workflow.

Decisions in Rulebricks are represented as "rules" that use [decision tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_table) to make your underlying business logic easy to understand and maintain.
