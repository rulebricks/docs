# Gradient

_What if your rules could write themselves?_

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Gradient is a new feature coming to Rulebricks that watches the data flowing through your Contexts and automatically surfaces the decision patterns hiding in it. That credit approval workflow your team runs manually? Gradient sees that 94% of applicants with scores above 720 and debt ratios below 30% get approved—and generates the rule for you.

### From Data to Decisions

Your Contexts already capture the facts that matter: what arrived, when, what was decided. Gradient analyzes this history to find what drives outcomes.

**It discovers patterns like:**

- Orders from gold-tier customers over $500 are always expedited
- Applications missing employment verification stall 3x longer than others
- Price adjustments above 15% require manager approval regardless of other factors

These become draft rules you can review, refine, and publish. The implicit knowledge in your business becomes explicit, auditable logic.

### Finding process-level bottlenecks

Beyond rule generation, Gradient identifies where decisions get stuck. Which facts are most often missing when applications stall? Where would a new integration have the highest ROI?

This turns operational friction into actionable insights—you see exactly which data gaps cost you the most.
