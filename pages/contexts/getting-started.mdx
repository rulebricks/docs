# Getting Started with Contexts

Let's build a Customer Context that tracks customer data across multiple sources and automatically runs your bound rules when the required information is available.

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### Create a Context

Go to **Dashboard → Contexts** and click **Create Context**.

![Context Tab](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/context-tab.png)

Name it "Customer" and set `customer_id` as the identity fact—this is what uniquely identifies each customer flowing through the system.

### Define Your Facts

In the Context Editor, add the facts your decisions need:

![Define Facts](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/define-facts.png)

| Fact          | Type    | Required |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `customer_id` | string  | Yes      |
| `name`        | string  | No       |
| `email`       | string  | No       |
| `tier`        | string  | Yes      |
| `income`      | number  | Yes      |
| `address`     | object  | No       |
| `nicknames`   | list    | No       |
| `subscribed`  | boolean | No       |

Mark facts as **required** if rules can't execute without them. Facts like `tier` and `income` might be required for your decisions, while profile data like `nicknames` is optional.

### Add a Derived Fact (Optional)

Derived facts calculate automatically from other facts or related entities. Add a `total_spent` fact that aggregates transaction amounts:

![Derived Facts](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/derived-facts.png)

```javascript
sum($relations.Transaction, 'amount')
```

This updates whenever a related Transaction is added or modified. You can also create derived facts like `transaction_count` to track how many transactions a customer has.

### Link Your Rule

Create a rule, set its input schema to **From Context**, and select the Customer context. Any rules you create in this way will read from context facts and write their decision results back automatically.

### Test It

Use the **Console** tab to explore live customer instances:

![Context Console](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/context-console.png)

Enter a customer ID like `c_001` to fetch the instance and see all base facts (name, tier, income, etc.) and derived facts (transaction_count, total_spent). When required facts are present, bound rules/flows execute automatically– if you've already set those up, you should be able to see their outputs write-back to your live context accordingly.

</Steps>

## Using the API

Submit facts to a context instance via POST:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://rulebricks.com/api/v1/contexts/customer/c_001" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "tier": "gold", "income": 200000 }'
```

The response shows current state:

```json
{
  "status": "pending",
  "have": ["customer_id", "tier", "income"],
  "need": []
}
```

When all required facts are present and a bound rule exists, the response includes rule execution:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "cascaded": [
    {
      "rule": "customer-decision",
      "result": { "tier_benefits": ["free_shipping", "priority_support"] }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Concepts

- **[Facts and Schema](/contexts/key-concepts/facts-and-schema)** — Derived facts, history tracking, and schema design
- **[Execution Mode](/contexts/key-concepts/progressive-execution)** — How auto-execution and cascades work
- **[Binding Rules](/contexts/binding-rules)** — Connect rules to read from and write to contexts
