# Getting Started with Contexts

Let's build a loan approval Context that collects data from multiple sources and automatically runs your approval rule when everything's ready.

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### Create a Context

Go to **Dashboard → Contexts** and click **Create Context**.

![Context Tab](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/context-tab.png)

Name it "Loan Application" and set `application_id` as the identity fact—this is what uniquely identifies each loan application flowing through the system.

### Define Your Facts

In the Context Editor, add the facts your approval decision needs:

![Define Facts](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/define-facts.png)

| Fact | Type | Required |
|------|------|----------|
| `application_id` | string | Yes |
| `credit_score` | number | Yes |
| `annual_income` | number | Yes |
| `employment_verified` | boolean | Yes |
| `approval_decision` | string | No (output) |

Mark facts as **required** if rules can't execute without them. Mark `approval_decision` as **output only**—your rule will write to it, not external systems.

### Add a Derived Fact (Optional)

Derived facts calculate automatically from other facts. Add a debt-to-income ratio:

![Derived Facts](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/derived-facts.png)

```javascript
monthly_debt / (annual_income / 12)
```

This updates whenever `monthly_debt` or `annual_income` changes.

### Bind Your Rule

Open your loan approval rule, set its input schema to **From Context**, and select the Loan Application context. The rule will now read from context facts and write its decision back.

### Test It

Use the **Console** tab to simulate data arriving:

![Context Console](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/context-console.png)

Submit facts one at a time and watch the `have`/`need` arrays update. When you submit the last required fact, your rule executes automatically and writes `approval_decision` back to the context.

</Steps>

## Using the API

Submit facts to a context instance via POST:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rulebricks.com/api/v1/contexts/loan-application/APP-12345" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "credit_score": 720 }'
```

The response shows current state:

```json
{
  "status": "pending",
  "have": ["application_id", "credit_score"],
  "need": ["annual_income", "employment_verified"]
}
```

When the final required fact arrives, the response includes the rule execution:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "cascaded": [{
    "rule": "loan-approval",
    "result": { "approval_decision": "approved", "max_loan_amount": 250000 }
  }]
}
```
