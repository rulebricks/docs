# Webhooks

Contexts can call your endpoints when something happens—a rule executes, a context expires, or an error occurs.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Events

| Event | When it fires |
|-------|--------------|
| `context.solved` | A bound rule executed successfully |
| `context.expired` | The context's TTL elapsed |
| `context.error` | A rule execution failed |

## Configuration

In the Context Editor, add a webhook URL and select which events to send.

Rulebricks signs each request with your webhook secret (available in settings). Verify the `X-Rulebricks-Signature` header to ensure requests are authentic.

## Payload Structure

**context.solved:**

```json
{
  "event": "context.solved",
  "context": "loan-application",
  "identity": "APP-12345",
  "rule": "credit-check",
  "result": {
    "risk_tier": "low",
    "approved": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**context.expired:**

```json
{
  "event": "context.expired",
  "context": "loan-application",
  "identity": "APP-12345",
  "final_state": {
    "have": ["application_id", "credit_score"],
    "need": ["employment_verified"]
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-22T10:30:00Z"
}
```

<Callout>
The `final_state` on expiration shows what was still missing—useful for understanding why a decision couldn't be made.
</Callout>

## Retry Behavior

Failed deliveries (non-2xx response) retry with exponential backoff: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes, then hourly for up to 24 hours.

After 24 hours of failures, the webhook is disabled and you'll receive an email notification.
