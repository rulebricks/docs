# Binding Rules

Binding connects a rule to a Context. Once bound, the rule reads its inputs from context facts and writes its outputs back—no API calls required on your end.

## How Binding Works

When you bind a rule to a context:

1. The rule's **request schema** maps to context facts it reads
2. The rule's **response schema** maps to context facts it writes
3. The rule executes **automatically** when all its inputs are present (unless set to manual mode)

This is what makes progressive execution work—you submit facts, rules run when ready, results appear as new facts.

## Binding a Rule

<Steps>

### Open the Rule

Navigate to your rule in the dashboard and open the **Settings** tab.

### Set Input Source

Under **Input Source**, select **From Context** and choose the context to bind to.

The rule's request schema fields will map to context facts with matching names. If names don't match exactly, you can configure field mappings.

### Set Output Destination

Under **Output Destination**, select **To Context**. 

The rule's response fields will write to context facts with matching names. These should be marked as **output only** in the context schema so external systems can't overwrite rule decisions.

### Choose Execution Mode

Select when the rule should execute:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Enabled** | Runs automatically when all inputs are present |
| **Manual** | Only runs when you call `/solve` explicitly |
| **Disabled** | Won't run (useful for staged rollouts) |

### Save

Click **Save**. The rule is now bound and will participate in progressive execution.

</Steps>

<Callout>
You can bind multiple rules to the same context. They'll execute in dependency order—a rule that reads `risk_tier` waits for the rule that writes it.
</Callout>

## Cascading Rules

When Rule A writes a fact that Rule B needs, B executes automatically after A:

```
Facts arrive: credit_score, annual_income
       ↓
[Credit Check Rule] executes → writes: risk_tier
       ↓
[Pricing Rule] now has all inputs → executes → writes: rate, max_amount
```

This happens within a single API response. The `cascaded` array shows what ran:

```json
{
  "cascaded": [
    { "rule": "credit-check", "result": { "risk_tier": "low" } },
    { "rule": "pricing", "result": { "rate": 4.5, "max_amount": 500000 } }
  ]
}
```

## Viewing Bound Rules

From the Context dashboard, the **Rules** tab shows all bound rules, their execution mode, and which facts they read/write.
