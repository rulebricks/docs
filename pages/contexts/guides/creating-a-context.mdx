# Creating a Context

This guide walks through creating a Context in the dashboard. We'll build an order fulfillment context that tracks orders from placement through delivery.

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### Open Context Settings

Navigate to **Dashboard → Contexts** and click **Create Context**.

![Context Tab](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/context-tab.png)

Enter a name and slug. The slug appears in your API URLs:

```
POST /api/v1/contexts/{slug}/{identity}
```

### Choose the Identity Fact

Every context needs an identity fact—the unique ID for each instance. For order fulfillment, this is `order_id`.

Set the identity fact type (string or number) and name. This becomes the key in your API URLs:

```
POST /api/v1/contexts/order-fulfillment/ORD-12345
```

### Define Facts

Add the facts your decision logic needs:

For each fact, specify:

- **Name and type** — `items` (list), `shipping_address` (object), `payment_confirmed` (boolean)
- **Required** — Whether rules need this fact to execute
- **Output only** — Whether only rules can write to it (not external submissions)

### Add Derived Facts

Derived facts compute automatically from other facts. Click **Add Derived Fact** and write an expression:

![Derived Facts](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/derived-facts.png)

Example: calculate order total from line items:

```javascript
sum(items, 'total_price')
```

Derived facts recalculate whenever their dependencies change.

### Configure Settings

Set the **TTL** (time-to-live) for context instances. Orders might expire after 30 days; real-time sessions might expire in 1 hour.

Optionally configure:

- **Webhook URL** — Called when contexts are solved or expire
- **Auto-execute** — Whether bound rules run automatically when ready

### Save and Test

Click **Save** to create the context. Use the **Console** tab to test:

![Context Console](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/contexts/context-console.png)

Submit facts and watch the `have`/`need` arrays update. Derived facts appear as soon as their inputs are available.

  The Console is useful for understanding how facts interact before integrating
  with your application.

## Next Steps

- **[Binding Rules](/contexts/guides/binding-rules)** — Connect rules to read from and write to this context
- **[Relationships](/contexts/guides/relationships)** — Link contexts together (customers with orders)
