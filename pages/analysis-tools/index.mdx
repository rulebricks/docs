# Analysis Tools

Rulebricks provides two powerful analysis tools in the rule editor to help you understand how your rules perform in production and how changes might affect outcomes.

import { Cards, Card } from 'nextra/components'
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Available Tools

### Impact Analysis

Test how changes to your rule conditions would affect outputs **before deploying**. Impact analysis replays historical requests through modified conditions to show you exactly what would change.

![Impact Analysis](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/rule-analysis-tools/impact-analysis.png)

**Use it when:**

- You're considering changing a condition value
- You want to compare the current rule version against a previous one
- You need to understand the downstream effects of a rule change

### Reachability Analysis

See which rows in your decision table are actually being matched by production traffic. Reachability analysis shows you hit frequencies and helps identify dead code or optimization opportunities.

**Use it when:**

- You suspect some rows are never being matched
- You want to optimize rule evaluation order
- You need to understand which conditions are causing the most rejections

## Accessing the Tools

Both tools are available in the **footer bar** of the rule editor and are available on any paid plan. Click **Impact** or **Reachability** to open the respective analysis panel.

<Callout type="info">
  Results are based on your rule's execution logs, so you'll need some
  production traffic before the analysis becomes meaningful.
</Callout>

For static analysis of rule structure (without production data), see [Rule Warnings](/warnings)—which examines your rule for potential issues like unreachable rows and coverage gaps.
