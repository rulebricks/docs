# Objects in Rulebricks

You've got a customer object with `tier`, `credit_score`, and `lifetime_value`. You'll use those fields in a dozen rules. Do you really want to type them out each time?

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Objects are team-level schema definitions that provide field suggestions when you create rules or contexts. Define your data structure once, and every rule you build can pull from it.

## What Objects Give You

**Field suggestions** — When building a rule, select an Object and its fields appear in the schema editor. No retyping, no typos.

**Automatic Dynamic Values** — If your Object uses JSON Schema with `enum` fields, Rulebricks extracts those values and creates dropdown options in your rule conditions.

**Consistency** — When everyone builds rules from the same Objects, field names stay consistent across your workspace.

## Two Schema Formats

**JSON Schema** — Full schema definitions with types, validation rules, and enums:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "customer_tier": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["bronze", "silver", "gold", "platinum"]
    },
    "credit_score": {
      "type": "number",
      "minimum": 300,
      "maximum": 850
    }
  }
}
```

**JSON Object** — Plain example objects when you just want field suggestions without full validation:

```json
{
  "customer_id": "cust_12345",
  "order_total": 299.99,
  "is_priority": true
}
```

Rulebricks auto-detects which format you're using.

  **Objects vs Contexts:** Objects define data structures. Contexts track data
  as it arrives over time and execute rules progressively. If you have all your
  data upfront, use Objects to define your schema. If data arrives from multiple
  sources at different times, use [Contexts](/contexts).

## Getting Started

See **[Creating Objects](/objects/creating-objects)** for three ways to add Objects to your workspace—manual creation, AI-powered import from existing documentation, or pre-built templates.
