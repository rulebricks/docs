metaDescription: Three ways to create Objects in Rulebricks—manual creation, AI-powered Smart Import, or pre-built templates.

# Creating Objects

import { Tabs, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['Manual', 'Smart Import', 'Templates']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

Go to **Team → Objects** and click **Add Object**.

Enter a name and paste or write your JSON. Rulebricks detects whether it's a JSON Schema or plain JSON Object automatically.

Good for quick definitions when you know exactly what structure you need.

Let AI generate a schema from your existing documentation.

Click **Smart Import** and provide:

- **Name and description** of what you're modeling
- **Attachments** — PDFs, spreadsheets, SQL DDL files, images, or URLs
- **Notes** — Additional context or constraints

Click **Generate** and Rulebricks creates a complete JSON Schema.

**Supported files:** PDF, Excel, CSV, Word, JSON, SQL/DDL, images (with OCR), and web URLs.

Good for converting existing specs, database schemas, or documentation without manual translation.

Pre-built schemas for common use cases.

Click **Use Template**, browse categories or search, preview the schema, and click **Add to Workspace**. Templates are pretty good for getting started quickly with industry-standard data structures.

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Objects in Rules

When creating a rule, click **From Object** to pull fields from an existing Object:

![Create Rule Using Object](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/objects/create-rule-using-object.png)

Select the fields you need and they're added to your rule's schema—correctly typed and named.

## Automatic Dynamic Values

When you save a JSON Schema with `enum` fields, Rulebricks extracts those values and creates Dynamic Values:

![Objects Create Values](https://d1zic6dm9txw4h.cloudfront.net/rulebricks-docs-assets/static/images/revisions/objects/objects-create-values.png)

These appear as dropdown options in your rule conditions, so instead of typing `"gold"` you select it from a list. Fewer typos, faster rule building.

<Callout>
  Objects can be used to inform rules and contexts. Update the Object and you
  have a single source of truth for that data structure.
</Callout>
