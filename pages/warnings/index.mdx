# Rule Warnings

Rulebricks analyzes your decision tables and warns you about structural issues—rows that can never be reached, conditions that shadow later rows, gaps where inputs might fall through.

Warnings appear in the rule editor footer. Click to see details and jump to the affected rows.

<Callout type="info">
  Warnings use **static analysis**—they examine your rule structure without
  needing production data. For runtime analysis based on actual traffic, use
  [Analysis Tools](/analysis-tools).
</Callout>

## Severity Levels

**Error (Red)** — Definite problems that will cause incorrect behavior. Unreachable rows, catch-alls blocking everything below them. Fix these before publishing.

**Warning (Yellow)** — Likely issues that deserve attention. Partial overlaps, coverage gaps, unhandled boundary values. Review to ensure the behavior is intentional.

**Info (Blue)** — Informational notices. Missing catch-all row, incomplete coverage suggestions. Consider whether these apply to your use case.

## Common Issues

**Catch-All Blocking:** A row with "any" for all conditions matches everything, blocking all rows below it. Move catch-alls to the bottom.

**Unreachable Rows:** Every input that would match a row is already caught by an earlier row. Reorder so more specific conditions come first.

**Coverage Gaps:** A range of values won't match any row. Add handling for the missing range, or verify your catch-all covers it.

See **[Warning Types](/warnings/warning-types)** for detailed explanations and fixes for each warning.
